# 🐙 Elixir fundamentals

This is by no means an exhaustive guide on the fundamentals of Elixir. However, it should provide you with the ability to read Elixir syntax with relative ease and understand what it does. For more in-depth information about Elixir, refer to the [official documentation.](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction.html)

## Getting started

To try out Elixir, you can use the interactive shell (IEx). This should be automatically installed when you have [installed Elixir](prerequisites.md). Go to your terminal and type

```
iex
```

You should see a prompt like this:

```
λ ~/ iex
Erlang/OTP 26 [erts-14.2.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:1] [jit] [dtrace]

Interactive Elixir (1.16.0) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)> 
```

Then, you can try running each commands in this environment.&#x20;

Alternatively, you can also create a `.exs` file and run it via `elixir <filename>.exs`.
