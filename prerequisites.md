To follow along with this guide, please ensure that you have the following setup on your machine.

1. Install Elixir locally, for more instructions, refer to [this guide](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
2. Clone the demo repository for the code snippets

```
git clone https://github.com/woojiahao/practical-elixir-demo
