# üê• Welcome!

Functional programming can be an intimidating subject to approach. Your first encounter with it might be during CS2030S or hearing about Haskell. While using functional programming involves a shift in the way you think of problems, it does not have to be as intimidating as it seems.

In this guide, I ([Jia Hao](https://woojiahao.com/)) will be diving into the application of functional programming in web development using my favorite programming language: [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)!

## Why Elixir?

Besides being my favorite programming language, I think Elixir provides an incredibly gentle introduction to core [functional programming language principles](why-functional-programming.md#what-makes-functional-programming-amazing). It does not have an overly strict type system or mandate pure functions for everything. While these may go against the very purist idea of functional programming, it lowers the barrier to entry to functional programming and applying it to real-world projects.
